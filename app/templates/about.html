            <p>
                We continuously monitor financial discussion forums and social communities where investors share their thoughts 
                and opinions. The platform automatically identifies which stocks are being mentioned, analyzes whether the 
                sentiment is positive or negative, and presents this information in an easy-to-understand format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to help you see what the investing community is talking about right now, spot emerging trends, 
                and get a sense of market sentiment—all in one place.
