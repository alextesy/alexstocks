            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                We continuously monitor financial discussion forums and social communities where investors share their thoughts
                and opinions. The platform automatically identifies which stocks are being mentioned, analyzes whether the
                sentiment is positive or negative, and presents this information in an easy-to-understand format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to help you see what the investing community is talking about right now, spot emerging trends, 
                and get a sense of market sentiment—all in one place.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Our Data Sources</h3>
            <p>
                We gather discussions from multiple major financial communities, including popular forums focused on retail
                trading, general market discussions, and long-term investing strategies. Stock price information comes from
                reliable market data providers to give you accurate, real-time pricing alongside the sentiment data.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">How to read the pages</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Home:</strong> Shows the current market leaning, the last Reddit scrape time, hourly mention trends, and today's surge cards to spot movers quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Ticker pages:</strong> Start with a quick stat row (price, today's articles, users, and totals), then use the combined price & sentiment chart to toggle datasets or switch periods (24h, 7d, 30d). Filters below let you narrow by sentiment, source, and date range.</li>
