- After ANY code change to Python files, automatically run these commands in sequence:
  1. `uv run ruff check --fix .` (auto-fixes linting issues)
  2. `uv run black .` (formats code)
  3. `uv run mypy .` (type checking - no fix option, but must pass)

- If any of these commands fail, fix the issues before proceeding.
- Run all three commands even if only one file was changed (they're fast).
- Only skip if the user explicitly requests otherwise.
